def once(func):
    """
    A thread-safe decorator that ensures the decorated function runs exactly once,
    caching and returning its result for all subsequent calls. This prevents
    race conditions in multi-thread environments by using a lock to protect
    the execution state.

    Args:
        func (callable): The function to be executed only once.

    Returns:
        callable: A wrapper function that executes `func` on the first call
                  and returns the cached result thereafter.

    Example:
        @once
        def compute_expensive_value():
            print("Computing...")
            return 42

        # First call: executes and prints
        # Subsequent calls: return 42 without executing
